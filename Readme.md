### Overview

This is a repo that serves to contain configuration scripts for my homelab.  My homelab consists of 5 raspberry pi 3 b+, running raspbian lite, one ubuntu server, and a Digital Ocean droplet running a VPN for remote management.  

Creds for the VPN server need to be provided as usual in a file under /vpn


### TODO's

 - Build out TF files to create digital ocean droplet for VPN server
 - Figure out why host keys were being aggressively checked, possibly from the .ssh config file?
 -
