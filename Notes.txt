People who have deployed a private registry: how do you, like, monitor this thing?

How do you mean?  I think monitoring like you would any web service.
I'm not super duper in the know here.  I'm chiming in to hopefully learn something too.  Is it different?

test the api, test 'docker login' have a test container spin up a nginx server on port 80 on a known IP...
I kinda use the last one via cron, er rundeck but still.

Like... does it export any metrics of its own. Are there disk level things I should be watching that might indicate oncoming problems (other than the usual suspects). Can it tell me "yo shit's about to be fucked" or not

I think that depends on which hub you're using. I don't think the gitlab one does, not sure about 'docker hub' but the nexus and artifactory ones do, I think.
